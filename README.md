# Sawtna – AI-Powered Safe Palestine Content Posting App

---

## 🌟 Introduction

Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, and Telegram use automated moderation systems. These often:

- ❌ Delete images or videos related to Palestine.
- ⚠️ Restrict or ban accounts (shadowban).
- 😔 Silence journalists and activists.

**Sawtna (صوتنا – "Our Voice")** is an AI-powered mobile app designed to help Palestinians and activists:

- 🛡️ Share their stories without being censored.
- 🤖 Automatically check whether content (image or text) will likely be flagged.
- ✨ Modify risky content (blur, rewrite) while preserving the message.

## 📊 Dataset Collection

**📌 Sources**

- **Facebook** → Public pages and groups.  
- **Instagram** → Hashtags like `#Gaza`, `#FreePalestine`.  
- **Twitter/X** → Trending hashtags, activist accounts.  
- **Telegram** → Public resistance/solidarity channels.

**📸 Image Dataset**  
Each image was manually labeled into two categories:

- ✅ Allowed → Safe for posting (e.g., Palestinian flag, peaceful protest).
- ⚠️ At Risk → Likely to be removed (e.g., visible blood, corpses, destruction).

**📝 Text Dataset**  
Collected captions from the same sources in Arabic & English and also labeled into two categories (Allowed, At Risk).

## 🚀 Core Features

1️⃣ **Image Classification**  
- Deep learning model (VIT).  
- Input: an image → Output: Allowed / At Risk.

2️⃣ **Image Filtering (Risk Reduction)**  
- If the image is "At Risk":  
  - Use segmentation models (SAM) to detect sensitive regions (blood, corpses).  
  - Apply one of the following filters like Gaussian Blur → smooth blur.  
  - ✅ Final result = an image that conveys the message but avoids deletion.

3️⃣ **Text Classification**  
- Transformer model (XLM-RoBERTa).  
- Input: caption text → Output: Allowed / At Risk.

4️⃣ **Text Re-Generation**  
- If text is “At Risk”: Automatically rewrite it into safer language while keeping meaning.

5️⃣ **Text-to-Image Generation (API)**  
- Integrated with Pollinations API / Stable Diffusion.  
- Create artistic images from prompts.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend (Mobile App)**: Flutter  
- **Backend & AI Models**: Python, PyTorch, FAST API  
- **Computer Vision**: VIT, SAM  
- **NLP**: MARBERT (Arabic BERT), mBERT  
- **Image Generation**: Stable Diffusion v1.5, Pollinations API  
- **Data Storage**: Google Drive, CSV files

## 📊 Workflow

The application works in a pipeline where each user input passes through several AI models before producing the final safe content:

1️⃣ **User Upload**  
- The user uploads:  
  - Image (from their gallery or camera)  
  - Caption (text description they want to post)

2️⃣ **AI Moderation Check**  
- The system applies two classifiers:  
  - **Image Classifier** → Analyzes the photo to decide:  
    - ✅ Allowed → Safe to publish.  
    - ⚠️ At Risk → Might be censored by platforms (contains blood, corpses, destroyed houses, etc.).  
  - **Text Classifier** → Analyzes the caption text:  
    - ✅ Allowed → Neutral/safe text.  
    - ⚠️ At Risk → Contains sensitive words that trigger censorship (e.g., “martyr”, “terrorist”, “kill”)

3️⃣ **Risk Handling**  
- If either the image or caption is At Risk:

**Image Processing (Computer Vision)**  
- The app segments the risky regions (blood, corpses, wounds).  
- A filter is applied to hide shocking details: Blur, Pixelation, Fog/mask

**Text Processing (NLP)**  
- If the caption is risky, the app rewrites it automatically.  
- This ensures the meaning is preserved but the post is less likely to be flagged.

**Safe Image Generation (API)**  
- If the user prefers to avoid uploading real photos, they can use AI Image Generation.

## 🔗 Note:
-To test the models, please place all test scripts inside the /models folder.
 models are not stored in this repository due to size constraints.
You can download them from the following Google Drive link:
📥 https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XxmGQmw3bwyusGOjhf-ywcqkpDTGBwb2
Once downloaded, put the models in the /models directory before running the test scripts.
